        "Description": "Almost all cell types in our body share the same genetic information, but they perform very different functions. For example, our nerve cells are morphologically and functionally distinct from our muscle cells. How can the same genome give rise to hundreds of distinct cell types in our body ? How can different diseases affect identical twins sharing the same genetic information ? Why our parents and grandparents diet and health may have lasting influences in our own health ? The field of epigenetics emerged over the past decades to tackle these fundamental questions that intersect our genome, development, environment and disease. This course will provide a broad overview of epigenetic phenomena and epigenetic mechanisms with weekly lectures and small group discussion of primary literature. The course will introduce students to seminal works in epigenetics and recent developments with the goal of instilling critical knowledge of the field.",

Many data have intrinsic spatial properties (e.g., locations, geometry, and boundary) and subsequent relationships and interactions in space and time. Such spatial data are critical to find solutions or develop applications for emergency management, environmental sustainability, public health, smart city, public safety, business logistics, driverless cars, ecological conservation, and many other problem domains. This course aims to help students develop knowledge and skills to ask spatial questions, find, process and analyze spatial data, solve spatial problems, and communicate their findings. Specifically, the course will introduce spatial data analytics and machine learning methods. Central to the course is learning how to think through spatial problems and formulate solutions in spatial data science frameworks. How can we leverage spatial properties of data to advance our understanding of the roles, functions, and processes of location, space, and place on the society, environment, and their interactions ? How does spatiality provide efficient frameworks to organize information, conceptualize real-world problems, and innovate solutions ? Technically, we will explore machine learning with ArcGIS and proceed with open-source Python libraries (e.g., pandas, geopandas, scipy, stats, scikitlearn, and if time permits, keras and tensorflow) with cloud technologies, for example, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.",

Why it is rational for German companies to grant their workers veto rights over management decisions, but not for U.S. firms ? Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy. Understanding the effect of these differences is essential for managers designing investment strategies or policy makers developing policy recommendations.

        "Description": "Since the late 20th century, human development theory (HDT) has inspired the way that the world envisions and practices international development, particularly for marginalized peoples and communities. From large multilateral agencies like the World Bank, bilateral donors like USAID, international and national nonprofit organizations, governments, to grassroots civil society organizations, the definition and purpose of development is shifting. Today, much of work of key stakeholders like Malala's Fund, Partners in Health, Save the Children, DFiD, and the Millenium Development and Sustainable Development Goals (MDGs/SDGs) builds on the principles of HDT. This development approach considers `` namely, advancing the richness of human life, rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live, which is only a part of it''. HDT seeks to improve individual capacities and human freedom. This course will introduce students to the history of international development policy in relation to the eventual promotion of HDT. Students will learn more about how international development policy, programs, agencies, nonprofits, and donors can work together to improve the quality of life with dignity for those who often face dire poverty, injustice, systemic violence, and insecurity. We will explore key'freedoms' (political, economic, social opportunities, transparency, and protective securities) that help unleash the potential of individuals to overcome obstacles and become actors of change in their life, community, and nation. This course is recommended for any students who have an interest in working in nonprofit, health, foreign service, international development, human rights, or public policy. Students will complete weekly readings and practices, as well as participate in course discussions and debates. Over the course of the semester, students will have the opportunity to work individually, in groups, and/or with an external agency to write a grant proposal or to complete a research paper on a relevant topic of their choice.",

        "Description": "This course will examine trends in illicit activity in the global economy. It will engage with how, on one hand, the `` dark side'' of globalization creates spillovers such as violence, corruption, and public health crises. Yet, on the other hand, illicit markets may help people gain access to better livelihoods to provide for their families or to needed goods. The class will focus on the politics of government decisions surrounding illicit markets, including prohibition, enforcement, and international cooperation. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to think about the intersection of economic and security issues, alongside the applied public policy concerns around control different types of transnational crime. Topics will include several cross-border illicit markets such as illegal drugs, small arms, wildlife, and kidnapping. The class centers around understanding five questions about each topic: Who is gaining or losing from the illicit market ? What stage is illegal (production, transit, consumption) ? When did the issue area become a regional or international concern ? Where does the illicit commodity move ? Why is the trade illegal in some places (and perhaps not others) ? (Same as PSCI 4317)",

When economic explanations fall short, analyzing the role of politics in finance can provide answers. This course aims to provide such answers by analyzing the interplay between politics and finance. The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as `` What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events ? ``, `` How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks ? ``, `` Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam ? ``, and `` Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not ?'' This course is particularly suited for students interested in careers in business or government. Future investors and government officials will need the skills necessary to analyze the two-way relationship of politics affecting finance and finance shaping politics.",

But the problem of national and international security continue to be a dominant concern of national and international political and economic life, just as it has been for more than sixty years. Many nations continue to maintain high levels of military expenditure as a mainstay of their security policy. Yet, there has been a profound change in the nature of the threats to security since the Cold War. Some, like the threat of intentional full-scale global nuclear war, have receded. Others, like the threat posed by nuclear proliferation and the terrorism of mass destruction, have increased. From acute hot spots to longer-term questions of restructuring power and security arrangements in a post-Cold War world, understanding the deeper issues of national and international security is critical to understanding what lies behind the headlines -- and what strategies are likely to be effective in achieving real security. Topics include: the nature and meaning of security; security and military force; terrorism, accidents and accidental war; nuclear proliferation; the international arms trade; the experience of war; the economics of security policy; social and psychological factors; and strategies for achieving security by nonmilitary means.",

It must be `` organic.'' Organic growth, in turn, depends on establishing an effective, responsible government, rule of law, and effective economic regulation. Moreover, this legal regime can not be merely national; it must be international. This course reviews the experiences that lie behind this realization, the issues and organizations it involves, and the steps being taken to implement it all international and national levels.",

Emphasis is placed on the use of economic tools for modeling environmental problems and their policy and management solutions. Students will be exposed to principles of microeconomic fundamentals (market models, benefit-cost analysis, etc.) and the major concepts of public goods and externality theory, which are applied to a variety of traditional and contemporary cases of environmental management and policy. Students will review and discuss scholarly research articles in the area of six major environmental research topics, such as (1) indoor air quality management, (2) outdoor air quality management, (3) water quality management, (4) hazardous solid waste management, (5) pesticides and toxic chemical management, and (6) climate change and global sustainable development.",

Why was Malaysia able to deal with the East Asian financial crisis, while Korea and Thailand were not ? Why did Argentina default on its debt while Brazil did not, even though it had the higher debt burden ? This course provides answers to these questions by analyzing the interplay between politics and finance. The first section of the course deals with the differences in corporate governance: the configuration of the domestic financial sector differs across countries, with implications for the way stock markets and banks are operating. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The third and final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. This course aims to provide students with the ability to analyze a two-way relationship: how politics affects finance as well as how finance shapes politics.",

        "Description": "With the end of the decades-long Cold War, the US has become the world's only superpower. But the problem of national and international security continue to be a dominant concern of national and international political and economic life, just as it has been for more than sixty years. Many nations continue to maintain high levels of military expenditure as a mainstay of their security policy. Yet, there has been a profound change in the nature of the threats to security since the Cold War. Some, like the threat of intentional full-scale global nuclear war, have receded. Others, like the threat posed by nuclear proliferation and the terrorism of mass destruction, have increased. From acute hot spots to longer-term questions of restructuring power and security arrangements in a post-Cold War world, understanding the deeper issues of national and international security is critical to understanding what lies behind the headlines -- and what strategies are likely to be effective in achieving real security. Topics include: the nature and meaning of security; security and military force; terrorism, accidents and accidental war; nuclear proliferation; the international arms trade; the experience of war; the economics of security policy; social and psychological factors; and strategies for achieving security by nonmilitary means.",

The course begins with an examination of the different cognitive processes that are important for effective cyber security. These include perception, attention, working memory, and long term memory. We next focus on different forms of reasoning and decision making relevant to interactions in cyberspace. These include inductive, deductive, analogical, and abductive reasoning. Lastly, we will consider how human judgment, heuristics, biases, expertise and social/group problem solving affect human performance. We will also consider the relevance of technology characteristics and human-computer interaction methods. These topics will all be covered from both a cyber-attack and a cyber-defense position to provide a thorough understanding of the possible mindset, motive, and capabilities of an attacker and how best to implement defense methods. The focus throughout will be on current research and theory in this rapidly evolving field. Department consent required.",
